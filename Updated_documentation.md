### **Is the Galformer Code Correct for Portfolio Recommendation?**

**Short Answer**: **Partially**. The code correctly predicts future stock prices using a Galformer model, which is a crucial step. However, **portfolio recommendation requires additional steps** beyond predicting individual stock prices.

#### **Why the Code is Partially Correct**

1. **Predictive Modeling**:

   - **Correct**: The Galformer model predicts future stock prices, which is fundamental for portfolio construction.

2. **Portfolio Construction**:

   - **Missing**: Portfolio recommendation involves allocating assets based on predicted returns and risk assessments.

#### **What is Missing for Portfolio Recommendation?**

1. **Return Calculation**:

   - **Expected Returns**: Convert predicted prices into expected returns for each asset.
     - **Approach**: Compute percentage change between current prices and predicted future prices.

2. **Risk Assessment**:

   - **Covariance Matrix**: Calculate the covariance matrix of asset returns to understand the risk (volatility and correlations).
     - **Approach**: Use historical returns to estimate variances and covariances.

3. **Portfolio Optimization**:

   - **Objective**: Optimize the allocation of assets to maximize expected return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given expected return.
     - **Approaches**:
       - **Mean-Variance Optimization** (Markowitz Model).
       - **Convex Optimization** with constraints.
       - **Risk-Parity**, **Sharpe Ratio Maximization**, etc.

4. **Constraints and Preferences**:

   - **Constraints**: Include constraints like budget (sums to 1), maximum/minimum allocations, diversification requirements.
   - **Preferences**: Incorporate investor preferences, such as risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalancing Strategy**:

   - **Time Horizon**: Decide how often to rebalance the portfolio based on new predictions.

6. **Backtesting**:

   - **Validation**: Backtest the portfolio strategy over historical data to evaluate performance.

### **How to Extend Your Code for Portfolio Recommendation**

#### **Step 1: Calculate Expected Returns**

- **Convert Predicted Prices to Expected Returns**:

  ```python
  # Assuming 'predictions_df' contains predicted prices for each company

  latest_prices = {}  # Dictionary to store latest actual prices

  for company in predictions_df['Company'].unique():
      company_df = all_dfs[f'df_{company}']
      # Get the most recent closing price
      latest_price = company_df[f'{company}_Close'].iloc[-1]
      latest_prices[company] = latest_price

  # Merge latest prices into predictions_df
  predictions_df['Latest_Price'] = predictions_df['Company'].map(latest_prices)

  # Calculate expected returns
  predictions_df['Expected_Return'] = (predictions_df['Predicted_Price'] - predictions_df['Latest_Price']) / predictions_df['Latest_Price']
  ```

#### **Step 2: Estimate Risk**

- **Calculate Historical Returns**:

  ```python
  historical_returns = []

  for company, df in all_dfs.items():
      company_name = company.replace('df_', '')
      # Calculate daily returns
      returns = df[f'{company_name}_Close'].pct_change().dropna()
      returns.name = company_name
      historical_returns.append(returns)

  # Create a DataFrame of historical returns
  returns_df = pd.concat(historical_returns, axis=1)
  ```

- **Compute Covariance Matrix**:

  ```python
  covariance_matrix = returns_df.cov()
  ```

#### **Step 3: Optimize Portfolio**

- **Define Optimization Problem**:

  ```python
  import cvxpy as cp

  # List of assets
  assets = predictions_df['Company'].unique()

  # Expected returns vector
  expected_returns = predictions_df.groupby('Company')['Expected_Return'].mean().reindex(assets).values

  # Covariance matrix extracted for the assets
  cov_matrix = covariance_matrix.loc[assets, assets].values

  # Variables: portfolio weights
  weights = cp.Variable(len(assets))

  # Objective: maximize expected return for a given level of risk
  risk_aversion = 0.5  # Adjust based on risk preference

  portfolio_return = expected_returns.T @ weights
  portfolio_risk = cp.quad_form(weights, cov_matrix)

  objective = cp.Maximize(portfolio_return - risk_aversion * portfolio_risk)

  # Constraints
  constraints = [
      cp.sum(weights) == 1,        # Weights sum to 1
      weights >= 0,                # No short selling
      weights <= 0.1,              # Maximum 10% allocation to any single asset (example constraint)
  ]

  # Problem setup
  problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
  problem.solve()
  ```

- **Retrieve Optimal Weights**:

  ```python
  optimal_weights = weights.value
  portfolio = pd.DataFrame({
      'Asset': assets,
      'Weight': optimal_weights
  })
  ```

#### **Step 4: Interpret and Utilize Portfolio**

- **Investment Recommendations**:

  - Use `portfolio` DataFrame to guide investment decisions.

- **Performance Evaluation**:

  - Backtest the portfolio to assess expected performance.

#### **Step 5: Integrate into Existing Code**

- **Add Portfolio Optimization Code After Predictions**:

  - After making predictions and calculating expected returns, proceed with the optimization steps.

- **Ensure Data Consistency**:

  - Align the dates and assets between predicted returns and historical returns used for covariance estimation.

### **Conclusion**

- **Your Galformer code is correct for stock price prediction**, which is a critical component of portfolio recommendation.

- **To perform portfolio recommendation**, you need to extend your code to include portfolio optimization steps.

- **Next Steps**:

  1. **Calculate Expected Returns** from predicted prices.
  2. **Estimate Risk** using historical data to compute the covariance matrix.

### **Additional Recommendations**

- **Utilize Specialized Libraries**:

  - Consider using libraries like **PyPortfolioOpt** for portfolio optimization, which simplifies many of these steps.

    ```python
    from pypfopt import EfficientFrontier, risk_models, expected_returns

    # Calculate expected returns and sample covariance matrix
    mu = expected_returns.mean_historical_return(returns_df)
    S = risk_models.sample_cov(returns_df)

    # Incorporate predicted returns
    # Adjust mu with your expected returns from predictions
    mu.update(predicted_expected_returns_series)

    # Optimize for the maximal Sharpe ratio
    ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)
    weights = ef.max_sharpe()
    cleaned_weights = ef.clean_weights()
    ```

- **Consider Risk Factors**:

  - Incorporate factors like **risk-free rate**, **transaction costs**, and **liquidity** into your model.

- **Monitor Model Performance**:

  - Regularly evaluate the predictive performance of your Galformer model and adjust accordingly.

- **Explore Advanced Techniques**:

  - Use **scenario analysis** or **stress testing** to assess portfolio robustness under different market conditions.
