## **Overview**

You aim to develop a comprehensive system that:

- Predicts stock prices for the next 25 days for the top 50 S&P 500 companies using both the **Galformer transformer model** and an **LSTM model**.
- Incorporates **economic indicators** and other features into the dataset.
- Performs **sentiment analysis** of news articles for each company.
- Summarizes news articles to provide context.
- Generates reasoning for predictions using language models.
- Compares the results of both models and presents them in an interactive **Streamlit app**.

Below is an updated step-by-step plan to achieve this, including the new steps you requested and suggested improvements to optimize the workflow.

---

## **Step 1: Fetch Historical Stock Data**

### **1.1 Data Collection**

- **Objective:** Collect historical stock data for the top 50 S&P 500 companies from 2003 to the present using the `yfinance` Python package.

- **Actions:**
  - **Install `yfinance`:**
    ```bash
    pip install yfinance
    ```
  - **Define the Tickers:**
    - Create a list of ticker symbols for the top 50 S&P 500 companies.
    ```python
    import yfinance as yf
    tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'FB', ...]  # Complete list of 50 tickers
    ```
  - **Download Historical Data:**
    - Use `yfinance` to download data from January 1, 2003, to the current date.
    ```python
    data = yf.download(tickers, start='2003-01-01', end='today')
    ```
  - **Data Fields:**
    - Ensure you collect relevant fields such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume'.

### **1.2 Data Storage**

- **Actions:**
  - **DataFrame Storage:**
    - Store the data in a Pandas DataFrame for each company.
  - **File Storage:**
    - Optionally, save the data to CSV files for backup or future use.

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- **Data Validation:**
  - Verify the completeness and integrity of the data for each company.
  - Handle any discrepancies or missing data at this stage.

## **Step 2: Incorporate Economic Indicators and Additional Features**

### **2.1 Fetch Economic Indicators**

- **Objective:** Enrich the dataset with macroeconomic indicators to improve model performance.

- **Actions:**
  - **Identify Relevant Economic Indicators:**
    - Examples include:
      - **Interest Rates** (e.g., Federal Funds Rate)
      - **Inflation Rates** (e.g., CPI)
      - **Unemployment Rates**
      - **GDP Growth Rate**
      - **Consumer Confidence Index**
  - **Data Sources:**
    - **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):**
      - Install the `fredapi` package:
        ```bash
        pip install fredapi
        ```
      - Use the API to fetch data:
        ```python
        from fredapi import Fred
        fred = Fred(api_key='YOUR_FRED_API_KEY')
        interest_rates = fred.get_series('FEDFUNDS')
        ```
    - **Other Sources:**
      - World Bank, IMF, OECD databases.
  - **Fetch Historical Data:**
    - Collect data for the same time period (2003 to present) to align with stock data.

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- **Automate Data Fetching:**
  - Create scripts to periodically update economic indicators to keep the dataset current.

### **2.2 Merge Economic Indicators with Stock Data**

- **Actions:**
  - **Data Alignment:**
    - Ensure that the economic indicators are aligned with the stock data by date.
    - Handle frequency differences (e.g., monthly vs. daily data) by forward-filling or interpolating values.
  - **Feature Integration:**
    - Add economic indicators as additional features to the stock data DataFrame.

### **2.3 Additional Feature Engineering**

- **Technical Indicators:**
  - Calculate indicators to enhance the feature set:
    - **Moving Averages (MA)**
    - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
    - **MACD**
    - **Volatility Measures**
    - **Momentum Indicators**

- **Lag Features:**
  - Create lagged versions of both stock prices and economic indicators to capture temporal dependencies.

- **Date-Based Features:**
  - Extract features like the day of the week, month, quarter, and whether a day is a holiday.

**Improvement Suggestion:**

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Perform statistical analysis to understand the relationship between features and target variables.
  - Remove or transform features that are not contributing to the model's performance.

---

## **Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

### **3.1 Handle Missing Values**

- **Actions:**
  - **Stock Data:**
    - Use forward fill or interpolation for missing stock prices.
  - **Economic Indicators:**
    - Handle missing values considering the nature of each indicator.
    - For forward-looking indicators, filling forward may not be appropriate; consider other imputation methods.

### **3.2 Normalize and Scale Features**

- **Actions:**
  - **Normalization:**
    - Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to scale numerical features.
    - Fit the scaler only on the training data to prevent data leakage.
  - **Categorical Encoding:**
    - If any categorical features are added (e.g., day of the week), encode them using one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

### **3.3 Split Data into Training, Validation, and Test Sets**

- **Actions:**
  - **Time-Based Split:**
    - Training: 2003-01-01 to 2018-12-31
    - Validation: 2019-01-01 to 2020-12-31
    - Testing: 2021-01-01 to current date
